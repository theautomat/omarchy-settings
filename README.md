# Omarchy Settings

Custom system settings and configurations for Arch Linux ARM on Asahi (Apple Silicon).

## Working with Claude

When using Claude Code on this repository:
- **Do not run commands without user confirmation first** - explain what you want to do and wait for approval
- Be cost-conscious - avoid running multiple exploratory commands in parallel
- Always explain the purpose of commands before executing them
- **Do not include Claude/AI attribution in git commit messages** - keep commits professional and focused on the technical changes

## Purpose

This repository contains **only customizations and modifications** made to the base system:
- Custom scripts and configurations
- Settings that have been changed from defaults
- Notes on system-specific tweaks needed for Asahi/Apple Silicon
- Guidance for replicating this setup on other machines

**Note**: Do not document default settings or read-only system information. Only include what has been actively customized.

## System

- **Base**: Arch Linux ARM on Apple Silicon (Asahi Linux kernel)
- **Custom layer**: Omarchy installed on top of base Arch
- **Hardware**: Apple Silicon (ARM64)
